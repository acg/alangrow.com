You can attach multiple files in [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/)'s file browser, if they're in the same directory: just use 't' to tag them, then ';'-Enter. (Quickly, one after the other.) You can also view files from the file browser before attaching them, just hit Space. Ten years of mutt and I'm still discovering this stuff...
