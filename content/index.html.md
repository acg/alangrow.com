## Hello World

I'm Alan Grow, a software developer and startup founder. With my co-founder Pliny, I run [Endcrawl](https://endcrawl.com/), the design software [many](https://x.com/alangrow/status/1870344485089222998/photo/1) [films & TV shows](https://pro.imdb.com/company/co0446605/filmography/?ref_=co_ov_all_credits) use to make end credits.

In a past life I co-founded [iLuminate](https://www.iluminate.com/), a finalist on [America's Got Talent Season 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Got_Talent_season_6#Grand-final_(September_13)). I've also written code for [ROLI](https://roli.com/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/products/bloomberg-terminal/), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows?r=1), [Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/global/en.html), [Betaworks](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows?r=1) startup Blend.io, and various startups you've never heard of. (Which is fine! They were fun!)

This is my technical blog. It started on Movable Type in 2002, was later migrated to jekyll, and now runs on a Python SSG I threw together called [tinysite](https://github.com/acg/tinysite). Programmers just can't leave things alone can they? The entire site is [opensource](https://github.com/acg/alangrow.com).

You can [email me here](mailto:alangrow+nospam@gmail.com). If you're weird and paranoid here's my [pgp pubkey](./alangrow.asc). I'm also active at [github.com/acg](https://github.com/acg) and [@alangrow](https://x.com/alangrow).
