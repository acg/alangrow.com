## Hello World

I'm Alan Grow, a software developer and startup founder. With my co-founder Pliny, I run [Endcrawl](https://endcrawl.com/), the end credits design software used by [many](https://x.com/alangrow/status/1870344485089222998/photo/1) [films & TV shows](https://pro.imdb.com/company/co0446605/filmography/?ref_=co_ov_all_credits).

In a past life I co-founded [iLuminate](https://www.iluminate.com/), a finalist on [America's Got Talent Season 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Got_Talent_season_6#Grand-final_(September_13)). I've also written code for [ROLI](https://roli.com/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/products/bloomberg-terminal/), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows?r=1), [Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/global/en.html), [Betaworks](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows?r=1) startup Blend.io, and a bunch of startups you've never heard of, which is fine, because we had fun.

This is my technical blog. It started on Movable Type in 2002 and has been ported through a few static site generators over the years. Currently it runs on a Python SSG I threw together called [tinysite](https://github.com/acg/tinysite). This site is [opensource](https://github.com/acg/alangrow.com).

You can [email me here](mailto:alangrow+nospam@gmail.com) (and here's my [pgp pubkey](./alangrow.asc)). I'm also active at [github.com/acg](https://github.com/acg) and [@alangrow](https://x.com/alangrow).
